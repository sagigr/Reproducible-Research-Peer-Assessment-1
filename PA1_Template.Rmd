## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
# 1.  Making a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day.
'''{r totalsteps}
totalsteps <- tapply(activitydata$steps, activitydata$date, FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)
hist(totalsteps, main="Total Number of Steps per Day", 
     xlab="Total Number of Steps", ylab="Frequency", col="Blue", breaks=25)
'''
# 2. Calculating and reporting the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day.
'''{r meanmedian}
mean(totalsteps, na.rm=TRUE)

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
# 1. Making a time series plot of the 5-minute interval and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days.
'''{r avdailyactivity}
intaveragesteps <- aggregate(x = list(averagesteps = activitydata$steps), by = list(interval = activitydata$interval), FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)

# 2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
'''{r maxnumbersteps}

## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
